                        <p class="light">This is the school I went to. I studied Game Design there and passed the first stressful year (only half of the student could pass). During the second year I decided to finish my project, Trouble Phone, then leave the school. I didn't have any money left to pay for it and only 6 on 30 students managed to find a part time job at that time, I wasn't part of that lucky minority.</p>
                        <p class="light">But as the second year was already less useful as the first one, no big deal. I left, learned game programming and Unity for a while and got back on Trouble Phone with the goal of polishing it</p>
